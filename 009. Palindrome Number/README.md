# 009. Palindrome Number
-------------------------------

## Description
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.

**Some hints:**
Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)

If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.

You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?

There is a more generic way of solving this problem.

## 解题思路
把数一位位取出来再比较就可以完成要求了，但是题目说不使用额外的空间？是不使用其他变量的意思吗？
